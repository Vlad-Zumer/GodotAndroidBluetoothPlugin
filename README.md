# GodotAndroidBluetoothPlugin
## [Project Status : CLOSED]
Android bluetooth library for Godot.

## Postmortem
Due to Google's requirement that access to the bluetooth requires the location to be turned on I am closing this project.

I do not believe that allowing apps (other than the one using the bluetooth) to access location every time the bluetooth is used for a peer to peer connection by another app is required.

I would also not trust an app that requires location to be turned on if the app is not using the location.

If I can find a workaround I might reopen this project.
